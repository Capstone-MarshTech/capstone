## ðŸ“¦ Tech stack:

### MERN

- React.js / Vite
- Recharts
- Material-UI: Data Grid
- State Management: Redux
- Axios

Backend:

- Node.js
- Express.js
- pandas
- python-dotenv
- pymongo

## ðŸ’¾ Installation:

### /Server

- cd into the Server directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file at the top level of the Server folder. This will hold the MongoDB connection string and server port number. Example:

```
MONGO_URI = "mongodb+srv://<your connection string here>/<your DB name here>"
PORT=<your server port number here>
```

Create a `data` folder at the top level of the Server folder, and place the original csv file in here. Rename it `demo_original.csv`.

Create a `mongodb_uploads` folder at the top level of the Server folder. Change directory into the `scripts` directory and run the files in this order:

```
python clean_csv.py
check_data_quality.py
feed_mongo.py
```

To get the server up and connect to the DB, cd into the Server directory and run:

```
npm run dev
```

### /Client

- cd into the Client directory and run:

```
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file at the top level of the Client folder. This will hold the `VITE_BASE_URL`. Example:

```
VITE_BASE_URL=http://localhost:<your port number here>
```

To ge the React app up and running, from the Client folder run:

```
npm run dev
```

After running the above command, use the local URL provided in your browser to see the React app.
